IF YOU WANT TO TRAIN DATA, MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD MNIST_TRAIN.CSV AS IT IS NOT INCLUDED

Somewhat simple multilayer neural network that can take any number of layers and neurons on each layer, comments added by AI to help better understand the script.

Current data is trianed on 100 epochs, and can be used right out of the box (no need to train, just set Training var to false before running).

Overall a fun project, I learned a lot especially regarding backprop and computing gradients. From now, however, I'll most likely devleop using something more efficient and with better support, like pytorch.
